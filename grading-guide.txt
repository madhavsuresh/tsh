Test Cases: 

We will use the following test cases (and the associated test suite)
to evaluate and grade your project.  All test cases end with the
"exit" command.

1) just exit
2) single command execution
3) multiple commands, absolute and in PATH
4) pwd
5) multiple commands with more than one argument
6) cd and pwd
7) file that does not exist
8) multiple commands with more than one argument
9) cd and pwd
10) background job
11) multiple background jobs, and the jobs command
12) background and foreground jobs
13) multiple background jobs, and the jobs command
14) background and foreground jobs
15) multiple background jobs, and the jobs command
16) background jobs and fg command
17) background jobs, fg command, then foreground jobs
18) ctrl-c signal
19) background and foreground jobs, ctrl-c signal
20) background and foreground jobs, ctrl-z signal, fg command
21) background and foreground jobs, ctrl-z signal, bg command
22) background job, fg command, ctrl-z, fg command
23) ctrl-z, bg and fg commands on the same job
24) ctrl-c signal
25) ctrl-c and ctrl-z handled by the shell
26) ctrl-z, fg and bg commands to multiple jobs
27) ctrl-c handled by the shell
28) single set of pipes
29) single set of pipes
30) single set of pipes

For extra credit (total 20 points):

There are 4 extra credit test cases, worth 5 points each.

31) multiple pipes
32) multiple pipes
33) redirection
34) redirection, < and > on the same command line

Using the sdriver.pl driver script:

To automatically test your project, we use the testsuite/sdriver.pl
script to send signals to your shell.  As described in the handout,
you can run the driver from the testsuite directory:

./sdriver.pl -t testXX.in -s .././tsh

To see the output of the reference implementation, replace ".././tsh"
with "./tsh-ref".
